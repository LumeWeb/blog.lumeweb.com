In an ironic twist, the launch of our latest project coincided with Christmas Day. This was not planned but adds a unique touch to our journey.

At Lume Web, our mission is to advance Web3 while staying true to the foundational principles envisioned by Satoshi, and our early web1 roots. Central to this mission is fostering a community that embodies these valuesâ€”a community that is genuinely *ours*.

We believe it's crucial to move away from divisive tribalism. Instead, we should collaborate more effectively, focusing on technological innovation and the cyberpunk/lunarpunk/solarpunk ethos, rather than being driven by short-term gains and speculative behavior. Our overarching goals are to ensure the freedom of money and the freedom of speech, from which all our other objectives stem.

With this new site, our ambition is to return to the basics, to reignite the original spirit of the web, and to unite in creating a Web3 that truly reflects our ideals.

In summary, our call to action is simple: Embrace the cyberpunk essence and significantly reduce degenerative gambling tendencies. Let's build a Web3 that we can all be proud of.

Lastly, if you want your blog to be listed on the site, please reach out. The project is in its MVP stage and requires significant development. Contributions in the form of PRs or any other kind of help are greatly appreciated, so reach out for that as well! The repository can be found at https://git.lumeweb.com/LumeWeb/web3.news. At the time of writing, view the `develop` branch.
